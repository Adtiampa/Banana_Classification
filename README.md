![Project Banner]([https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400.png?text=Banana+Ripeness+Classification](https://s1.dmcdn.net/v/Frb_I1ZdQPV3184IS/x1080))

This project demonstrates how to **classify banana ripeness** (unripe, ripe, overripe, rotten) using a **deep learning model** built on top of **MobileNetV2**. By applying **data augmentation**, splitting data into **training**, **validation**, and **testing** sets, and fine-tuning **hyperparameters**, the system achieves high accuracy in predicting the ripeness level of bananas.

# 🍌 1. State the Problem 

## 1.1 Problem and Pain Point
- Currently, Thailand is experiencing a **banana 🍌 shortage**, leading to reduced banana production. Therefore, it is crucial to maximize the use of the limited banana supply. The **“Banana Tester” 🍌** was created to evaluate the ripeness level of bananas, as relying solely on human visual inspection of peel color and softness can be highly uncertain—subject to individual experience and environmental conditions. Moreover, fluctuating weather significantly affects the ripening rate, making it difficult to predict the ideal harvest time. Overripe or under-ripe bananas cannot be sold, resulting in economic losses, potential taste changes, and higher spoilage risks. Additionally, inconsistent ripeness levels among bananas increase labor and time spent sorting.  

## 1.2 Related Work
- **Research References:** [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14BA3__-aD1RJfIRNJK6RZnHvRPOLwT9w?usp=drive_link)  
- **Strengths and Weaknesses of Previous Research:**  
  From the studies reviewed, there are diverse methods of data collection, and the approaches for classifying banana ripeness are highly detailed. However, such methods can be time-consuming for data gathering. In contrast, our current experimental project involves faster data collection but still achieves comparable results.  

- **Identified Gap:**  
  Existing research lacks a user-friendly program or website capable of **real-time 🍌 analysis** of banana ripeness. Addressing this gap is the key motivation for our system’s development.  

## 1.3 Unique Method
- **Connecting Previous Research with Our Approach:**  
  Both the reviewed studies and our current project share a similar objective—solving the uncertainty in human-based banana 🍌 ripeness classification. Such misclassification often leads to waste from prematurely rotten bananas. Therefore, the main aim of these studies and our project is to increase the accuracy of banana ripeness classification by leveraging **AI 🤖**. Ultimately, this extends to creating a real-time web-based tool for easy and immediate use.
